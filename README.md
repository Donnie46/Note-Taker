# Note Taker

## Description

Welcome to the Note Taker application! Given front end starter code, I have built the back end for note taker application using Express.js. The app allows users to write and save notes, with data stored in a JSON file. Connect the back end to the existing front end and deploy the complete application on Heroku.
